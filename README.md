# Statistics for Data Science Guided Project

## Overview

This repository contains my implementation of the Statistics for Data Science guided project from Coursera. 
The project focuses on applying fundamental statistical concepts using python, including meansures of central tendency, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis. 
The primary dataset used is the Iris dataset, analyzed using python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotplib.

This project was completed as part of the Coursera guided project taught by Mahammad Sadd Uddin.
I have added some personal touches to the analysis to enhance the learning experience and showcase my understanding.

## Project Objectives

- Calculate basic statisticial measures using pandas.
- Create visualizations such as histograms, kernel density estimates, and cumulative distribution funcations to explore data distributions.
